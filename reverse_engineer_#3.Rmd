## project overview 

## Our project looks at homicide arrests in 50 of this nation's largest cities across the past decade. We used this data to replicate findings from a Washington Post investigation into arrest rates of homicicde cases in the largest U.S. cities. In order to achieve this, we first analyzed the Washington Post investigation and identified the most significant data findings within the story. Once we identified the most significant data findings, we created this notebook to recreate those significant findings. Here are some of the most significant findings we replicated:
1. There was a killing nearly every day between 2015-2017 in Baltimore
2. About one in every four homicides in Baltimore resulted in arrests 2015 - 2017
3. Baltimore's homicide arrest rate dropped 14 percentage points between 2015 and 2017

## data dictionary 

## The only dataset being used to replicate the Washington Post findings is titled 'homicide_data' in this notebook. This dataset has 52,179 entries and has 12 columns.
col1: uid is the unique identification number for each homicide case
col2: reported_date is the year, month and day the homicide was reported
col3: victim_last is the homicide victim's last name
col4: victim_first is the homicide victim's first name
col5: victim_race is the homicide victim's race
col6: victim_age is the homicide victim's age
col7: victim_sex is the homicide victim's gender
col8: city is the city the homicide occurred in
col9: state is the state the homicide occurred in 
col10: lat is the latitude the homicide occurred at 
col11: lon is the longitude the homicide occurred at
col12: disposition is the outcome of the case
